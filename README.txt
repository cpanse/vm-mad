This is a repository of the code produced by the VM-MAD project,
funded by the SWITCH AAA scheme.

The aim of VM-MAD is to provide mechanisms for running scientific
applications on virtualized infrastructures (clouds). In detail,
VM-MAD consists of the following components:

  * a repository of VM images and associated metadata;
  * a Python library to control the full lifetime of a VM instance on different cloud backends;
  * an "orchestrator" component to extend SGE/OGS clusters with virtualized compute nodes;
  * command-line tools to access the basic functionality of the above
    components.
