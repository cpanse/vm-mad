Installation
============

These instructions show how to install VM-MAD from the source
repository into a separate python environment (called `virtualenv`_).
Installation into a virtualenv has two distinct advantages:

  * All code is confined in a single directory, 
    and can thus be easily replaced/removed.

  * Better dependency handling: additional Python packages 
    that VM-MAD depends upon can be installed even if they 
    conflict with system-level packages.

0. Install software prerequisites: 
   
   * On Debian/Ubuntu, install packages: ``subversion``,
     ``python-dev``, ``python-profiler`` and the C/C++ compiler::
     
       apt-get install subversion python-dev python-profiler gcc g++

   * On CentOS5, install packages ``subversion`` and ``python-devel``
     and the C/C++ compiler::

       yum install subversion python-devel gcc gcc-c++

   * On other Linux distributions, you will need to install:

     - the ``svn`` command (from the SubVersion_ VCS)
     - Python development headers and libraries
       (for installing extension libraries written in C/C++)
     - the Python package ``pstats`` (it's part of the Python 
       standard library, but sometimes it needs separate installation)
     - a C/C++ compiler (this is usually installed by default).


1. Choose a directory where the VM-MAD software will be installed;
   any directory that's writable by your Linux account will be ok.

   If you are installing system-wide as ``root``, we suggest you
   install VM-MAD into ``/opt/vm-mad``.

   If you are installing as a normal user, we suggest you install
   VM-MAD into ``$HOME/vm-mad``.


2. If it's not already installed, get the `virtualenv`_ Python package
   and install it::

      wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.5.1.tar.gz
      tar -xzf virtualenv-1.5.1.tar.gz && rm virtualenv-1.5.1.tar.gz
      cd virtualenv-1.5.1/
 
    If you are installing as `root`, the following command is all you
    need:

      python setup.py install

    If instead you are installing as a normal, unprivileged user,
    things get more complicated::

      export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib64/python:$HOME/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
      mkdir -p $HOME/lib/python
      python setup.py install --home $HOME

    (You will also need to add the two `export` lines above to the
    `$HOME/.bashrc` file -if using the `bash` shell- or to the
    `$HOME/.cshrc` file -if using the `tcsh` shell.)

    In any case, once `virtualenv`_ has been installed, you can exit
    its directory and remove it::
   
      cd ..
      rm -rf virtualenv-1.5.1


3. Create a virtualenv to host the ``vm-mad`` installation at the
   directory you chose in Step 1.::

       virtualenv $HOME/vm-mad # use '/opt/vm-mad' if installing as root
       cd $HOME/vm-mad/
       source bin/activate


4. Check-out the ``vm-mad`` files in a ``src/`` directory::
     
       svn co http://vm-mad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk src
   
  
5. Install the ``vm-mad`` in "develop" mode, so any modification
   pulled from subversion is immediately reflected in the running environment::

       cd src/
       env CC=gcc ./setup.py develop 
       cd .. # back into the `vm-mad` directory

   This will place all the VM-MAD command into the ``vm-mad/bin/``
   directory.


Upgrade
=======

These instructions show how to upgrade the VM-MAD scripts to the
latest version found in the GC3 svn repository.

1. `cd` to the directory containing the VM-MAD virtualenv;
   assuming it's named ``vm-mad`` as in the above installation
   instructions, you can issue the commands::

     cd $HOME/vm-mad # use '/opt/vm-mad' if root

2. Activate the virtualenv ::

     source bin/activate

3. Upgrade the `vm-mad` source and run the `setup.py` script again::

     cd src
     svn up
     env CC=gcc ./setup.py develop


HTML Documentation
==================

HTML documentation for the VMlib programming interface can be
read online at:
     
  http://vm-mad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/html/index.html

You can also generate a local copy from the sources::

  cd $HOME/vm-mad # use '/opt/vm-mad' if root
  cd src/docs
  make html

Note that you need the Python package `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`
(at least versdion 1.0) in order to build the documentation locally.
