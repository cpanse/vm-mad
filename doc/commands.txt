Commands
========

These instructions refer to the different commands inside VM-MAD and
to how do they interact among them. A basic description of what must be
the format of the various files is also given. 

Simulation
==========

This section treats the simulation part of VM-MAD. 

    * Before starting the simulation a distiled accounting data has to be available. 
    The distil.py tool has been provided for automating this part. 
    * Once the accounting data is available a simulation can be started using the simul.py
    tool. 

In the next subsections more detailed information about these tools will be provided.

1. Distil 
The purpose of this tool is to distill different kind of scheduling information, more precisely:

    *  the accounting data provided by SGE,
    *  the output given by querying with the ``qstat -xml`` command the SGE scheduler. 

You can see all the options provided by simply doing ``./distil.py -h`` 
The output produced by ``distil.py`` is in CSV format. 

2. Simulate 

TO BE DONE

File format: CSV
================

We widely use the CSV as file referencing format. Bellow the different
use cases where the format has been used.
